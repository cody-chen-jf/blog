This is my personal blog. You can also use it* as yours as well. Just simply remove my posts / pictures and add your own, then build it & enjoy.

Master branch is serving generated files, checkout `src` branch for source code.

_\* **it** means the program, which do not include the `posts` and `static` folder._

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# generate post index
npm run post

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
